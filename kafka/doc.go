// Package kafka provides a Consumer and a Producer for basic Kafka operations.
//
// It relies on https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go which is a Go wrapper on top of https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka.
// This provides a reliable implementation, fully supported by the community, but also from Confluent, the creators of Kafka.
